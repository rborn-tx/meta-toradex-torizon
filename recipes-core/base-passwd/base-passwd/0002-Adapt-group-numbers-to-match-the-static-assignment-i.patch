Subject: [PATCH 2/2] Adapt group numbers to match the static assignment in
 torizon

Some Unix groups (input, kvm, sgx) defined in OpenEmbedded layers have
numeric IDs that differ from the ones used by Torizon OS (as defined by
the "torizon-static-group" file) which may lead to users created during
build being assigned to wrong group numbers. Here we fix this situation
by changing them to match the assignment in the torizon-static-group
file; this is also helpful to ensure that group numbers remain the same
as in previous releases of the OS.

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [configuration]
